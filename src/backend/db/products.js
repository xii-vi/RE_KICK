    description:"The Off-White x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG was one of the most highly anticipated footwear collaborations of 2017. It marked the first time Virgil Abloh, founder of the Milan-based fashion label and Jordan Brand had teamed up. Nicknamed `The 10` edition, this pair comes in the original Chicago-themed white, black and varsity red colorway. Featuring a white, red and black-based deconstructed leather upper with a Swooshless medial side branded with `Off-White for Nike Air Jordan 1, Beaverton, Oregon, USA © 1985.` Other details include: floppy ankle collars with hidden `85` written on the inside, an oversized off-centered Swoosh on the lateral sides, `Air` written on the midsole and the word `Shoelaces` on the laces with no branding on the tongue. Their release date is set for 2017 where they retailed for $190 in men's sizes only. As if the hype wasn't enough, the limited availability made these Off-White x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG's highly sought after, way before their official release. Those of you in need of a pair can hit up the marketplace to buy them. If you got a pair and want to see what they're going for, check online and then decide if it's time to sell or wait."
